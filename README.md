# What-Is-This
This convertor converts mp4 to mp3<br>

# How-Does-It-Work
It is written in python and uses moviepy library to convert the file. It also uses easygui and tkinter for being user-friendly<br>
The difference between windows version and the other one is that in windows, it is using batch files to kinda automate the process. 
It also automates downloading of the two libraries that are needed<br>

# How-To-Use
If you use windows, then open the windows folder. Here you can hide all the files except "mp4 to mp3.bat"<br>
After that you can easily run that bat and the do whatever you want<br>
If you're using other ones, you have to first install easygui and moviepy libraries for your python and then run the python file<br>
